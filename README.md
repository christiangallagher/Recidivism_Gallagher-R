# Personal data projects
- __Project Purpose:__ I originally picked this data to use for a statistics class I took over the summer. I wanted to find data that had time served to see if it was more likly for white inmates to get shorter sentencing than black inmates. My goal for the project was to look at the racial bias that is in the criminal justice system. Originally when I explored the data I did not use the proprotional population to black and white people in America. I onlt looked at the raw numbers and it was not as I expected. Once we had started project 2 where we looked at the suicide numbers using the percentage of the population for each race I took that knowledge and applied it to this data. The graphics now clearly showed what I assumed from the beginning to be true. This work was solely done for my own interest in the court system. 


- __Tools used:__ I uesed R to make the graphics. Packages I used were tidyverse, ggplot2, and dbplyr. 


- __Results:__ I first made a graphic that was grouped by race and showed the age of release. I noticed right away that the black male inmates showed higher numbers than white male inmates. The highest number of inmates where in the black male group that were released at the age of 23 to 27.

I then made a heat map to look at the recidivism within 3 years of release compared to education level. The white inmates showed an equal spread across recidivism and education level. While the black inmates showed a higher recidivism rates in the less educated groups. The black inmates had a higher number of inmates not commiting crimes in the higher education group than white inmates.

- __Project Purpose:__ Take one to two paragraphs to explain your goals.  Why did you use this data? What skills are you going to demonstrate? Did you do this work for a client? 
- __Tools used:__ Provide an overview of the programming languages and packages you leveraged for this work.  You could provide links to the pertinent reading material that you leveraged to complete the job. Provide links to your final scripts stored in your repository.
- __Results:__ This is your conclusion.  Explain why your work matters.  How could others use it?  What are your next steps? Show some key findings.

## Writing about data science

[Thusan's article on how writing about data science is not easy](https://towardsdatascience.com/lets-admit-it-writing-about-data-science-is-not-easy-37a376777d36) could be helpful as you document your project and skills.

## Data sources

You don't need to make these projects complicated. These projects are built to show your work using the skills you have developed during the course. I would make sure that these are presentable in your Github space. You want to demonstrate your creativity. You could use the following links to find a new data set. 

- [FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data)
- [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)
- [WorkoutWednesday](http://www.workout-wednesday.com/)
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- [data.world](https://data.world/search?context=community&entryTypeLabel=dataset&q=free+data&type=all)

## Github pages

It would help if you took the time to publish your repo for easier viewing of the files.  Please follow the directions at [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) to build your pages footprint on the internet.

## Questions

### Is the expectation of our personal projects similar to that of the class projects we are completing?

Yes & No. Here are a few points to highlight the comparison

1. Three different data sets is the main criteria. Hopefully different challenges to your skills and the data can be in the same area for all three if you desire.
2. You can choose the language. Please choose based on where you want employment.
3. We don't get much into the story telling with our class projects.  But, I would hope you tell a story that includes some graphs and analysis.
4. Think of these as sales pitches for future employment. Your personal projects should be in your own Github space.
